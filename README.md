# What is it?

**IOS** Native application in **Swift/SwiftUi**


# Concept

This project is about a **social network** which allow **people and bigger organizations (mall, associations)** to **share and ask for some foods, clothes or anything they got in surplus**, for **free** by posting announcements only in a restrict area. Made during a little stage une a apple bootcamp


## Where will it work?

It have to take place in **Paris** or in a **big city**


## What I have to do to make it work?

I only need a **back end** like a **SQL data base**, to work on the **Nav link**, and maybe some little feature that I can **optimize** a bit a that's it!

## Who helped me?

I did it with some guys I met in the bootcamp which I liked to work with! But nothing more

## Purpose for this one?

it was a project made for a jury in order to get a SwiftUi certification
